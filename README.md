<h1>Course Description</h1>

This course provides an experience in working on a software development project that requires technical knowledge. Students will work in teams of 3 or 4 to identify a problem, design a solution to that problem, and implement that solution. The solution must involve creating software and may involve also creating hardware.

<h1>Student Learning Objectives</h1>

<ol>

 <li>Identify a real-world problem amenable to solution by software, perhaps with accompanying hardware.</li>

 <li>Design a software solution to a given problem.</li>

 <li>Analyze the feasibility of implementing a given software design.</li>

 <li>Apply technical knowledge gained from courses and readings in the technical literature to a project.</li>

 <li>Collaborate effectively as a team member.</li>

 <li>Analyze and reflect, verbally and in writing, on a software development process.</li>

</ol>

<h1>Credit Hours</h1>

Federal Credit Hour Definition: A credit hour is an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutionallyestablished equivalency that reasonably approximates not less than one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester. This equates to 45 hours per credit per semester, or 180 hours for this class.
